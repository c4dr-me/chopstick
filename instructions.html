          <h2>Game Setup</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Both Player 1 and Player 2 start with 1 finger on each hand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Hand Selection</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A player can select their own hand if it has 4 or fewer fingers.
              The selected hand will be highlighted.
            </li>
            <li>
              A player can attack an opponent's hand with their selected hand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Attack</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a hand is attacked, the number of fingers on the attacking
              hand is added to the attacked hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the total number of fingers on the attacked hand exceeds 4, it
              becomes a "fist" (represented as 5 fingers).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Splitting</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A player can split the total number of fingers between their two
              hands if the total number of fingers is even and greater than or
              equal to 4.
            </li>
            <li>
              The split distributes the total fingers equally between the two
              hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Splitting cannot occur if both hands already have 4 fingers each
              (maximum allowed).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Turn Management</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After an attack or split, the turn ends and switches to the other
              player.
            </li>
            <li>
              The game checks if both hands of a player exceed 4 fingers, which
              would mean the other player wins.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Game Over and Reset</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a player has both hands with more than 4 fingers, the game
              declares the other player as the winner.
            </li>
            <li>The game can be reset to the initial state.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Hand Display</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The number of fingers on each hand is displayed using
              corresponding SVG images.
            </li>
            <li>The images are updated dynamically based on the game state.</li>
